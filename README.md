## Description

Inspired by sophisticated project management applications such as Smartsheet, ClickUp, Atlassian, ProjectFox and other similar cutting edge softwares I wanted to practice my skills this time by building my own project management application. I introduce to you: SiriuS. 

In this application you can send emails to invite collaborators, keep track of all your invitations, manage collaborators, create and archive projects, share documents and more. For this MVP (Minimum Viable Product) I wanted to reproduce a minimum amount of features for the demonstration of the application. Also, I kept in mind all forementioned softwares and decided to keep the design simple and clean so users can focus the attention on what really matters. I used Semantic UI React as my frontend framework to focus less in CSS styling and more in the use of React functional components, Hooks, Redux, Rails, and developing the features I had in mind.

There was _much_ more I would've loved to add to this application such as graphs, charts, to-do lists, open/close ticket tasks, and other great features but it's time to focus on honing other skills and expand on what this app taught me. I will definitely continue to work and improve this project's code base and features as I grow as I developer.

This MVP was built with the intent to solidify foundational skills on React as well as Rails as an API. There is still a lot of work to be done and learning to do but I am a proud creator of __SiriuS__.

#### Inspiration

In Portuguese we call a [crab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab) a [_"Siri"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4PDorXSXEU&ab_channel=PronounceNames) (pl. _Siris_) and I used to love watch them walking in every direction, changing quickly to avoid obstables (mostly me and my cousins chasing them), then quickly running to the water, catching the waves and allowing the currents to lead them back to the ocean. So I decided to play with the idea of the serious nature of a  project management application and that ability of a crab _(Siri)_ to circumvent obstacles and play with the words __Serious + Siri__ = ___SIRIUS___. 

Managers and supervisors have that incredible ability to juggle so many things at once, meet deadlines, change strategies to achieve previous or new goals, and after all that struggle they ultimately understand that they've given their best and achieved the goal that they envisioned for themselves and for their teams. They know there is nothing else left to do other than just "surf the waters" and let the currents (unpredictable variables) take them to another realm of challenges, but also possibilities. That's what getting __SiriuS__ means.
