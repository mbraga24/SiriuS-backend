## Description

Inspired by advanced project management applications such as Smartsheet, ClickUp, Atlassian, ProjectFox and other similar cutting edge softwares I wanted to practice my skills this time by building my own project management application. I introduce to you: SiriuS. In this application you can send emails to invite collaborators, keep track of all your invitations, manage collaborators, create and archive projects, share documents and more. For this MVP I wanted to reproduce a minimum amount of features for a demonstration. Also, I kepts in mind all forementioned softwares and decided to keep the design simple and clean so users can focus the attention on what really matters. 

There was much much more I would love to add to this application such as graphs, charts, to-do lists, open ticket taks, and other great features but it's time to focus on other skills at the moment. I will definitely continue to work and clean up this project as I grow as I developer.
