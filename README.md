## Description

Inspired by sophisticated project management applications like Smartsheet, ClickUp, Atlassian, ProjectFox, and other similar cutting-edge software, I sought to enhance my skills by building my very own project management application. Allow me to introduce SiriuS.

Within this application, users can effortlessly send email invitations to collaborators, effortlessly track invitation status, efficiently manage collaborators, create and archive projects, and seamlessly share documents, among other functionalities. For this Minimum Viable Product (MVP), I aimed to showcase a select set of features that demonstrate the application's capabilities. Additionally, I strived to maintain a simple and clean design, drawing inspiration from the aforementioned software, enabling users to focus on what truly matters. To achieve this, I employed Semantic UI React as the frontend framework, minimizing CSS styling and emphasizing the use of React functional components, Hooks, Redux, and Rails for developing the envisioned features.

While there were additional features I desired to include, such as graphs and charts with metrics, to-do lists, ticket task management, and more, it is now time to concentrate on honing other skills and expanding upon the lessons this application has imparted. This MVP serves as a foundation for solidifying my React and Rails API skills. While there is still much work to be done, I take great pride in having worked on __SiriuS__.

#### Name

In Portuguese, we refer to a [crab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab) as a [_"Siri"_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4PDorXSXEU&ab_channel=PronounceNames) (pl. _Siris_), and I used to love watching them as they walked in various directions, swiftly changing course to avoid obstacles (usually my cousins and me chasing them), then promptly scurrying back to the water, riding the waves and allowing the currents to guide them back to the ocean. This inspired me to come up with the wordplay of __Serious + Siri__, resulting in ___SIRIUS___.
